# 🎓 Full-Stack Learning Management System (LMS)

This is my **first full-stack project**, a fully functional and modern **Learning Management System (LMS)** built using the **MERN stack**. It allows users to **add**, **purchase**, and **access courses**, track progress in real-time, **download certificates**, and even **apply to become instructors**. The UI is powered by **shadcn/ui**, with **secure PayPal integration** and **Cloudinary** for media management.
